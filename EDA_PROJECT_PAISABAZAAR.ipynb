        "  Ans:- Yes, these insights can inform better targeting strategies — offering customized financial products to different segments. However, the imbalance in the dataset and high proportion of \"Poor\" scores raise red flags. After analysing this, institute can make changes in their lending policy or changes in selection policy for lending as we can see only 17.83% individuals show sign of creditworthiness.If not addressed, it can negatively affect credit risk modeling, leading to poor decision-making and financial losses."
